# Turtlebot_public_subscriber
This project is getting started to learn how ros work, we use a turtle bot to draw circles.

# Requirement
Ubuntu
Install of ROS Noetic
IDE Applications such as Vs Code, PyCharm, Sublimeâ€¦

# Instruction
# Step One
Open IDE
Create package python script
Include this script into the file

  import rospy
  from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
  import sys
  
    def move_turtle(line_vel, ang_vel):
       rospy.init_node('turtlemove', anonymous=True)
       pub  = rospy.Publisher('/turtle1/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
       rate = rospy.Rate(10)
    
    
       vel = Twist()
    
    
       while True:
           vel.linear.x= line_vel
           vel.linear.y= 0
           vel.linear.z= 0
    
    
           vel.angular.x= 0
           vel.angular.y= 0
           vel.angular.z= ang_vel
    
    
           pub.publish(vel)
           rate.sleep()
    
    
    move_turtle(3.0, 2.5)

Save the file in any specific directory

# Step Two
Initialize source
Run command in terminal

# Step Three
Open another terminal
locate the specific directory

    cd specific folder
  
run the Python file

    rosrun turtle_draw_circle.py
